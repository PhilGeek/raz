# Referees' Report

## First Referee

Parts of this paper are interesting, and the author is certainly right that respect for persons and the law should be identified, that Kant has to use a broad notion of ends to make the formula of humanity work, or that the derivation of this formula should not be made to rest on the alleged human capacity to confer value. However, none of this is original; and the author, while acquainted with an impressive range of Kant's works, far too often resorts to sweeping statements about what Kant does or does not think, while rarely engaging in any detailed analysis of Kant's arguments. Some claims are simply false (e.g., Kant most emphatically does not restrict morality to 'what we owe to each other' (p. 26), if only because we do not owe each other acts of wide duty like mutual aid or duties to ourselves like the development of our own talents). At other times, the author does not even give references (e.g. bottom half of p. 5); and where references are given, they frequently do not support the theses the author ascribes to Kant (e.g. that all human beings possess equal and absolute worth, allegedly stated at 8:115, also p. 5). Moreover, s/he does not have much of a sense of the development of Kant's thought. For instance, the tripartite division on p. 2 is very much an innovation of the 1790s. With the exception of Allen (sic) Wood's book and Paton's commentary, none of the relevant literature is cited. The concluding paragraphs about Kant's views on religion are very odd, to say the least.

This paper is well written and contains some stimulating material comparing Kant’s views with those of Raz. Raz’s quasi-Kantian reflections on respect are of great interest given that Raz rejects many of Kant’s background assumptions. A comparative assessment of Kant and Raz on this point would be a very valuable contribution to the EJP’s Raz issue. However, the paper needs some work before it is publishable. I recommend the author (@) be invited to revise and resubmit.

One problem is that the paper’s overall ambition is never clearly stated and we are left in the dark about precisely what @ is trying to achieve. @ opens by saying that Kant and Raz’s views have more in common ‘than even Raz supposes’. The implication is that (i) @ is in the business of interpreting Kant and (ii) @ thinks that Kant’s views on respect can, in large part, be read in the light of Raz. But on p. 21 @ says that ‘Raz’s doctrine of value’s immanence is the basis of, if not an altogether faithful interpretation of the derivation, than a speculative reconstruction that is of some independent interest’. This gives quite a different impression of @’s objectives. Then on p. 22 we are told that the Kant’s  derivation ‘approaches’  the Razian, which implies that @ is back in the business of making textual claims.

I’ll reinforce this worry with specific examples from various parts of the paper but I want to emphasis that @ can’t deal with it on a case by case basis. @ needs to explain what he or she is about at the outset and then bring the appropriate evidence to bear. If a reading of the text  is intended then (a) much more detailed and extensive quotation from Kant is required and (b) @ must engage seriously with the secondary literature/alternative readings (and not just make a few friendly allusions to Woods and Paton).  If (as I suspect) @’s interests are not really textual then @ should do what Raz himself does and use a few passages from Kant  as a stimulus to @’s own Razian reflections on respect. Then @ won’t gratuitously annoy the legion of Kant scholars whose work @ (perhaps rightly) ignores.

I’ll add some remarks about specific passages:

pp. 4-7: In discussing whether the object of respect is the person or the law, @ could usefully engage with Velleman’s treatment of this at pp. 77-81 of From Self to Self. I wasn’t sure whether @’s differed from Velleman’s or not.
 

pp. 7-8: Here @ argues that, according to Kant, we cannot know a person’s inner worth. Kant does think this but, I suspect, not for the reason @ gives. @ attributes to Kant the view is that ‘there is no common standard to form the basis of moral comparison’ because some people have to try harder than others  to avoid doing specific wrongs and this is in turn because those people are tempted to commit those wrongs whilst others are not. On this view, our moral worth is a function of the amount of effort we put into complying with the moral law rather than whether we actually do comply (i.e. do the right thing for the right reasons).

In the Metaphysic of Morals Kant appears to reject this line of thought:

Ethical duties must not be determined in accordance with the capacity to fulfil the law that is ascribed to human beings; on the contrary, their moral capacity must be estimated by the law which commands categorically and so in accordance with our rational knowledge of what they ought to be … not in accordance with the empirical knowledge we have of them as they are. (MM: 404)

The passage from the Lecture on Ethics which @ quotes suggests otherwise but, @ needs to ask whether this passage from an earlier work reflects Kant’s mature view. Potentially more useful to @ here is the passage at MM: 228 which appears to support @’s reading. 

In any case, Kant has another reason for thinking us ignorant of our moral worth which is simply that we are ignorant of why we did what we did. On this reading, the standard of comparison is the same for all people - doing the right thing for the right reason – it is just that this standard is impossible to apply because we don’t know exactly why we did what we did. It is odd that @ overlooks this since it is explicitly stated in the second of the two passages from which @ quotes:

For a human being cannot see into the depths of his own heart so as to be quite certain, in even a single action, of the purity of his moral intention and the sincerity of his disposition, even when he has no doubt about the legality of that action. Very often he mistakes his own weakness, which counsels him against the venture of a misdeed, for virtue (which it is concept of strength); and how many people who have lived long and guiltless lives may not be merely fortunate in having escaped so many temptations. In the case of any deed it remains hidden from the agent himself how much pure moral content there has been in his disposition (MM: 393)

pp. 18-20: @ denies the view held by Korsgaard and others (e.g. Velleman op cit. pp. 40-4) that Kant is a constructivist about morality (and reasons more generally) @ may be correct but the point requires much more attention than @ gives it. In particular, the hypothesis that Kant is a constructivist would explain why Kant “makes no allowances for intrinsic, non-instrumental value that is not valuable in itself” (pp. 20 and 26). The instrumental value of things and the absolute intrinsic value of the capacity for rational choice must both be accepted by the will on pain of self-contradiction. No such thing is true of the value of reading Proust etc. So if he thought the will were the source of all value, then Kant would indeed overlook the distinctive value of Proust.

pp. 16 and 27-8: @ says that for Raz the unconditional nature of the value of the capacity for rational choice is independent of the stringency of the reasons it gives rise to. How independent? Could these reasons be very weak indeed? In any case, Raz’s derivation of the value of the capacity for rational choice falls well short of giving the rational will the dignity or absolute worth that Kant grants it. Given this, one wonders how @ can be right when @ says, after reviewing Kant’s own derivation of the dignity of the will that ‘it approaches Raz’s argument’ (p. 22).  If Kant is instead interpreted as a constructivist, the absolute value of the capacity for rational choice seems assured: how could the value of anything else outweigh the value of the capacity for rational choice if the former has its source in the latter? On p. 27 @ raises the issue once more but I’m afraid I just didn’t follow the material on religious awe and so forth. It should be clarified or dropped.
